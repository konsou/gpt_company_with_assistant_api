    Define Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly define the roles your AI agents will play (e.g., Product Owner, Tester, Reviewer, Team Lead) and their specific responsibilities.

    Design a Flexible Architecture: Implement a modular architecture that allows each agent to function independently while being capable of communication and collaboration with other agents.

    Implement Communication Protocols: Develop standardized communication protocols to enable efficient interaction among agents, allowing for data exchange and task coordination.

    Create a Central Controller: Initially, use a central controller to manage the predefined agents. This controller can later be adapted to dynamically spawn agents as required.

    Develop Agent Templates: For each role, create a template that includes the necessary APIs, data structures, and methods. This template can be instantiated with specific behaviors for different projects.

    Incorporate Scalability and Flexibility: Ensure the system is designed for scalability, allowing for easy addition or modification of agent roles without major architecture changes.

    Plan for Transition to Dynamic Spawning: Lay the groundwork for a future shift to a dynamic spawning system by including hooks and placeholders in your design that can later be expanded upon.

    Test and Iterate: Start with a simple implementation, test extensively, and iterate based on feedback and performance metrics to refine the system.
