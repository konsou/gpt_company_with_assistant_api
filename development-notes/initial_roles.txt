For an MVP of an AI programming system where you're the customer, consider starting with these essential roles:

    Product Owner (PO): Represents the customer's interests, defines requirements, and prioritizes tasks.
    Developer Agent: Writes code based on tasks defined by the PO. May include specialized agents for front-end and back-end development.
    Quality Assurance (QA) Agent: Tests the software to ensure it meets requirements and is free of bugs.
    Reviewer Agent: Reviews code for quality, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
    Deployment Agent: Manages the deployment of code to production or test environments.

This setup covers the critical aspects of software development: planning, coding, testing, reviewing, and deployment, providing a comprehensive approach for the MVP stage.
