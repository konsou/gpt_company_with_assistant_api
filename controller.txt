Skipping a separate Central Controller and allowing agents to communicate directly can simplify your architecture and reduce overhead. This approach emphasizes a decentralized model, where each agent operates semi-autonomously, coordinating with others as needed.

For spawning agents without a central controller, consider the following strategies:

    Static Initialization: Define a startup script that initializes all necessary agents based on predefined roles (PO, Developer, QA, Reviewer, Deployment). This script can be run at the beginning of each session or project.

    Dynamic Registration: Allow agents to "register" themselves on the message bus upon startup, announcing their role and availability. Other agents can then discover and interact with them based on their announced capabilities.

    Configuration File: Use a configuration file to define which agents to spawn and their initial parameters. This file can be read at startup to dynamically create instances of each required agent.

This model encourages flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy adjustments as your project evolves.
